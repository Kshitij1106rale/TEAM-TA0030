This is a project made by our team (TA0030) to help every problem of Farmers.
Problem Statement:

Small and marginal farmers face significant financial and operational risks due to late crop disease detection, fragmented access to mandi pricing data, and lack of profit forecasting tools. Existing agricultural applications provide isolated services such as weather updates or price listings but fail to deliver integrated, AI-driven decision support. This results in crop losses, suboptimal selling decisions, and unstable farmer incomes.

There is a need for an intelligent, accessible, and scalable platform that combines crop diagnostics, market intelligence, and financial forecasting into a unified ecosystem designed specifically for rural users.

Brief About the Idea:

AgriVision AI is an AI-powered smart farming intelligence platform that enables farmers to make data-driven decisions. The platform integrates crop disease detection using computer vision, real-time mandi price analysis, and profit forecasting into a single user-friendly system.

By leveraging artificial intelligence and predictive analytics, AgriVision AI transforms reactive farming practices into proactive, strategic decision-making.

How Different Is It From Existing Ideas?

* Existing solutions focus on single-function services (weather-only or price-only apps).
* AgriVision AI integrates AI diagnostics, market intelligence, and profitability forecasting in one platform.
* Designed specifically for small farmers with multilingual and simplified UI.
* Provides decision-support, not just information display.
* Scalable architecture capable of future IoT and satellite integration.

How Will It Solve the Problem?

* Early disease detection reduces crop loss.
* Market comparison engine ensures optimal selling decisions.
* Profit forecasting enables pre-harvest financial planning.
* Weather advisory reduces environmental risk.
* Integrated intelligence increases income stability.

USP of the Proposed Solution:

* AI-powered crop disease detection
* Integrated mandi price intelligence
* Profit estimation engine
* Multilingual rural-friendly design
* Scalable cloud-based architecture
* Future-ready for IoT & precision agriculture

List of Features Offered by the Solution:

* Leaf image upload with AI disease prediction
* Treatment and prevention recommendations
* Real-time mandi price comparison
* Highest-paying market suggestion
* 7-day price trend analysis
* Profit calculator with revenue forecast
* Weather-based farming advisory
* Secure user dashboard

(Add small icons/visual representation but maintain template design style.)
